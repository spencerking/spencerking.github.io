# CSE557A-Final-Project

## Files

### css
The css files used for the project.
It is mostly bootstrap.

### data
There are two files here, `data.tsv` and `data_removed_NA_genes.tsv`.
We realized after performing our pre-processing steps that not all variants had known genes.
We simply removed these variants from our dataset and used `data_removed_NA_genes.tsv` moving forward.

### img
Custom images used for the project.
We only used one, royalty-free, permissively licensed icon which we recolored.

### js
The Javascript files used for the project.
We implemented these ourselves and used some example code from the d3 documentation, cited in comments.
